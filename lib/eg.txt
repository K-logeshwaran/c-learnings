Insertion:

Insert at the beginning: Add a new node at the beginning of the list. DONE
Insert at the end: Add a new node at the end of the list. DONE
Insert after a specific node: Add a new node after a given node in the list.
Insert before a specific node: Add a new node before a given node in the list.
Deletion:

Delete from the beginning: Remove the first node from the list.
Delete from the end: Remove the last node from the list.
Delete a specific node: Remove a node with a given value from the list.
Delete after a specific node: Remove the node after a given node in the list.
Delete before a specific node: Remove the node before a given node in the list.
Traversal:

Iterate through the list: Visit each node of the list one by one, usually for printing or processing its elements.
Searching:

Search for a specific value: Find a node containing a given value in the list.
Search for a specific position/index: Find the node at a specific position/index in the list.
Accessing:

Access by index: Access the data of a node at a specific position/index in the list.
Updating:

Update the value of a specific node: Modify the data of a node at a given position/index in the list.
Length/Size:

Get the length/size of the list: Determine the number of nodes present in the list.
These are the fundamental operations commonly performed on linked lists. Depending on the implementation and requirements, additional operations or variations of these operations may also exist.
