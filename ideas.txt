Simple File Encryption/Decryption Tool:

Create a program that encrypts and decrypts files using a simple encryption algorithm, such as Caesar cipher or XOR encryption.
Allow users to specify input and output files along with a key for encryption/decryption.
Implement error handling and validation for file operations and user inputs.
This project will help you understand file I/O operations in C and basic encryption techniques.
Task Manager/To-Do List Application:

Build a command-line task manager where users can add, delete, update, and view tasks.
Use file storage to persist tasks between sessions.
Implement features like prioritization, due dates, and task categories.
Add functionalities for sorting and filtering tasks based on different criteria.
This project will deepen your understanding of data structures (linked lists, arrays) and file handling in C.
Network Chat Application:

Develop a simple chat application that allows users to communicate over a local network.
Implement a client-server architecture where multiple clients can connect to a server.
Use sockets for communication between the server and clients.
Add features like private messaging, chat room creation, and user authentication.
Ensure robust error handling and graceful handling of disconnections.
This project will introduce you to network programming concepts in C, including socket programming and multi-threading.
These projects are of intermediate complexity and will require a solid understanding of C fundamentals. They offer opportunities to enhance your skills in areas like file handling, data structures, networking, and error handling. As you work on these projects, don't hesitate to explore additional features or optimizations to further challenge yourself and expand your knowledge.


Beginner Level

Text-based Adventure Game:

Create a text-based adventure game where players navigate through different rooms, solve puzzles, and make choices that affect the outcome of the game.
Design a map with interconnected rooms, each with its own description and possible actions.
Implement a system for handling player input and responding to their choices.
Include features such as inventory management, character stats, and multiple endings based on player decisions.
This project will challenge your skills in handling user input, managing game state, and structuring game logic.
Simple File Compression Utility:

Develop a simple file compression utility that can compress and decompress text files using a basic compression algorithm like Huffman coding or Run-Length Encoding.
Implement functions to read from and write to files, as well as encoding and decoding algorithms.
Allow users to specify input and output files from the command line.
Provide options for compression and decompression, and display compression ratios.
This project will deepen your understanding of file I/O operations, algorithms, and data compression techniques.
Bank Management System:

Build a basic bank management system that allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, and view account details.
Use data structures such as arrays or linked lists to store account information.
Implement functions for account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.
Add features like interest calculation, account locking, and password authentication for security.
This project will help you practice working with data structures, functions, and managing program state.
These projects offer a bit more complexity compared to the previous ones, requiring you to integrate multiple concepts and implement more sophisticated features. They provide excellent opportunities to improve your problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and software design abilities while still being manageable for beginners.
